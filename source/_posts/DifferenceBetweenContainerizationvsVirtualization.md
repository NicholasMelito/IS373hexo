Containerization and virtualization are both techniques used to create isolated environments for applications, but they differ in how they operate and what they provide.

Virtualization
- **Layer of Abstraction**: Virtualization involves creating virtual machines (VMs) that emulate entire physical computers. Each VM runs its own operating system (OS) on top of a hypervisor, which manages the hardware resources.
- **Resource Usage**: Because each VM includes a full OS, they typically consume more resources (CPU, memory, and storage) compared to containers.
- **Isolation**: VMs provide strong isolation since each one is fully independent, with its own kernel.
- **Use Case**: Best suited for running multiple different operating systems or applications that require complete separation.

Containerization
- **Layer of Abstraction**: Containerization uses a shared OS kernel to run multiple applications in isolated user spaces called containers. Containers are lightweight and share the host OS.
- **Resource Usage**: Containers are more efficient in terms of resource usage since they do not require a full OS for each instance, making them faster to start and more efficient to run.
- **Isolation**: While containers provide a level of isolation, they share the same kernel, which can make them less secure than VMs in certain scenarios.
- **Use Case**: Ideal for microservices architectures, rapid deployment, and environments where quick scaling and resource efficiency are critical.

In summary, virtualization is more heavyweight and provides strong isolation, while containerization is lightweight and efficient, allowing for faster development and deployment cycles.
