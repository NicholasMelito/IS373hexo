Kubernetes and Docker are often mentioned together in the context of containerized applications, but they serve different purposes and address different aspects of containerization.

1. **Docker**:
   - **Purpose**: Docker is a platform for developing, shipping, and running applications in containers. Containers are lightweight, standalone, and executable packages that include everything needed to run a piece of software: the code, runtime, libraries, and dependencies.
   - **Components**:
     - **Docker Engine**: The runtime that allows you to build and run Docker containers.
     - **Docker Hub**: A registry where you can find and share Docker images.
     - **Docker Compose**: A tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications using a `docker-compose.yml` file.
   - **Focus**: Docker primarily deals with the creation, deployment, and management of containers.

2. **Kubernetes**:
   - **Purpose**: Kubernetes is an orchestration platform for automating the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications across a cluster of machines.
   - **Components**:
     - **Kubelet**: An agent that runs on each node in the Kubernetes cluster, ensuring that containers are running in a Pod.
     - **Kubectl**: A command-line tool for interacting with the Kubernetes cluster.
     - **Master Components**: Includes API server, scheduler, and controller manager, which manage the state of the cluster.
   - **Focus**: Kubernetes provides advanced features like load balancing, service discovery, rolling updates, and scaling. It manages the lifecycle of containers and ensures high availability and reliability of applications.

**In Summary**:
- **Docker** is used for creating and running individual containers.
- **Kubernetes** is used for managing and orchestrating clusters of containers, ensuring that they run efficiently and reliably across multiple machines.

In practice, Docker containers are often used with Kubernetes to provide containerized applications that Kubernetes can then manage and orchestrate.
